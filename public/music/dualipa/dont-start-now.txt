Verse 1:
Moving forward with my life
Leaving all the pain behind
Found my strength to carry on
Now I know where I belong

Chorus:
Don't start now with your regrets
I'm not looking back, no bets
Found my way to something new
This is what I'm gonna do

Verse 2:
Every step I take is mine
Everything is going fine
No more looking to the past
Freedom found at last
