Verse 1:
Feel the rhythm in the air
Music floating everywhere
Lift me up above the ground
In this magical sound

Chorus:
We are levitating high
Dancing underneath the sky
Feel the beat inside your chest
This moment is the best

Verse 2:
Stars are shining all around
Feet don't touch the solid ground
In this space we are so free
Perfect harmony
