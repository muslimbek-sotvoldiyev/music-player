Verse 1:
Walking through the city lights tonight
Everything feels so bright
Dancing to the rhythm of my heart
This is where the music starts

Chorus:
These are the blinding lights
Shining through the night
Feel the beat inside your soul
Let the music take control

Verse 2:
Moving to the sound of dreams
Nothing's quite the way it seems
In this moment we are free
This is our symphony
