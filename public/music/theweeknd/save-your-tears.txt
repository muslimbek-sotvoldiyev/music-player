Verse 1:
Looking back on yesterday
Wishing things could stay the same
But time keeps moving on
And we must carry on

Chorus:
Save your tears for another day
When the sun comes out to play
Hold onto the memories we made
They will never fade away

Verse 2:
Through the darkness we will find
Peace within our hearts and minds
Every ending is a start
Love will heal the broken heart
