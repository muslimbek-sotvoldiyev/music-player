[00:00] Sun is shining, it's over
[00:05] It's tomorrow
[00:10] Bathe yourself in the light, in your love
[00:15] XO
[00:20] Ever since I was young, knew I was different
[00:25] She keeps coming around, wants to be with me
[00:30] She thinks she's the one because I keep her close
[00:35] Double-O on my wrist, she knows that I'm timeless

[00:45] This is just a demonstration
[00:50] Of how synchronized lyrics work
[00:55] Each line has a timestamp
[01:00] For proper synchronization
[01:05] You can add your own lyrics here
[01:10] If you have the proper rights
[01:15] The system will highlight each line
[01:20] As the music plays along
[01:25] Timeless, timeless, we are timeless
[01:30] This love will never fade away
[01:35] Through all the seasons and the days
[01:40] Our hearts beat in perfect time
